# Flutter Wear OS POC

A simple stopwatch app to display wear OS features


## First Impressions
- WearOS is treated as Android only, code is under android/ folder üëç
- Easy bootstrap for wear, no heavy configs or changes to the default flutter project.(community plugin)
- Android WearOS Emulator keeps crashing.
- App **quits** on a swipe left gesture????

## Setup and Support

Community Support Plugin: https://pub.dev/packages/wear



## UI (Mobile vs Wear)

- Requires Big Buttons
- Scaffold renders in a rectangle but is clipped by the wearables shape
- Cant horizontal page views, cant swipe left



### Navigation

- Same as android, is a plus point
- Could be creative with a carousel

## Gestures (Mobile vs Wear)


## Wake-lock and other Wear-y behaviors

## Notifications
